Mars is the fourth closest planet to the Sun. In Winter tempetures are -125 degrees Celsius. In Summer the tempetures are 20 degrees Celsius, but can plummet down to -77 degrees Celsius at night. Mars no langer has a magnetic field and has lost it's atmosphere due to solar winds. When it is closer to the Sun it is more likely to have huge dust storms that envelop the entire planet. Recently NASA has figured out that Mars has liquid water on it.
