"description":"Earth is the third closest planet to the Sun. The temperature of the Earth's crust is 0 degrees and the core is 9000 degrees Fahrenheit. Earth takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun. It's ocean tides are because of the Moon. The Moon has been affected by the gravitational pull of the Earth causing it to slowly slow it's rotation until it is in sync with the Earth. This is why you always see the Moon no matter where you are in the world.",
