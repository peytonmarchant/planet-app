"name":"Venus",
"description":"Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun. It's gravity is 90% of Earth's with a diameter of 12,100 km. Venus has a very dense atmosphere, over 90x Earth's. The Venusian structure is similar to Earth's, with a partially molten and metallic core and a rocky mantle. Most unusual though, Venus is one of the hottest planets in the solar system, even though it is not the closest to the Sun. Venus also has the strongest greenhouse effect in the solar system, which is why it has a temperature of 460 degrees Celsius.",
